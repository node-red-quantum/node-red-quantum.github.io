## Node-RED Quantum
Quantum computing is a powerful state-of-the-art method of computation, capable of solving computational problems of astronomical proportions substantially faster than classical computers. However, the complex nature of quantum computing acts as a barrier for new developers and reduces the accessibility of the field.

To remedy this issue, we propose Node-RED Quantum: a library of nodes which brings quantum computing functionality to Node-RED, a browser-based visual flow editor. Our objective is to provide a simple and straightforward means of developing quantum algorithms, accessible by all users regardless of their expertise, so that non-experts are able to utilise the power of quantum computing.

Users can implement their own quantum solutions to computational problems, and gain a better understanding of quantum computing in the process. This node library allows users to construct quantum programs, run them on local simulators or IBM quantum machines, and integrate them with their own classical computer programs.
